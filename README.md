GitInsight is a GitHub Integration portal that searches repository domiciles in GitHub platform and profiles analytics of committers for the projects. It was built on top of Google's [Angular Framework](https://angular.io/). It is a powerful web application that provides insight to project contributors and committers. It has enough features to allow you to get the job done, but it is not crowded to the point where you can't find the files for a specific component.

 It has a login page and two menus: Dashboard and Analytics. Dashboard page affords you to search for a repository on the GitHub platform. Analytics page allows you to view the number of commits per committers so that the management could make strategic decision based on the insight outputs.

 GitInsight app is built by [Jacob Ajao](linkedin.com/in/jacob-ajao-9bb934113) that shows repository insight and searches.
